- Class: text
  Output: The first lesson explores the basic building blocks of R and its programming language

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its simplest role, R can be used as a mere calculator. For example, type 2 + 3 into the console and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 + 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 + 3')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: R will simply print the answer of 5. In R, standard mathematical rules apply and follow PEDMAS; parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. For example type 14/2+5 into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: 14/2+5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='14/2+5')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then type 14/(2+5) into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: 14/(2+5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='14/(2+5)')

- Class: text
  Output: The rules that have been applied result in two different answers so care needs to be taken to ensure you are completing the correct calulation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next up, square roots. You can find the square root of any non-negative number by using the sqrt function. Use the console to find the square root of 9. (Provide the desired number of 9 to x i.e. x=9)
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(x=9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(x=9)')
  Hint: Type sqrt(x=9) into the console and press Enter.

  Output: At some stage you may need to translate more complicated arithmetic formula into code. Some expressions may require extra parentheses especially when dealing with exponents in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If the exponent itself is an arthimetic calculation then it must appear inside parentheses. For example 2 to the power of 3 plus 1 would be 2^(3+1). What would 2 to the power of 4.25 minus 1/4 be?
  CorrectAnswer: 2^(4.25-1/4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2^(4.25-1/4)')
  Hint: The exponent 4.25-1/4 would be inside the parentheses

- Class: text
  Output: Note that R treats negative numbers as a calculation. This would mean -3 is seen by R as -1*3. Therefore to the power of -3 would be written as 2^(-3).
