  Course: R - The Basics
  Lesson: Arthimetic and Assigning Objects
  Author: Sarah Gill
  Type: Standard
  Organization: TModal
  Version: 2.4.3

- Class: text
  Output: The first lesson explores the basic building blocks of R and its programming language

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its simplest role, R can be used as a mere calculator. For example, type 2 + 3 into the console and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 + 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 + 3')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: R will simply print the answer of 5. In R, standard mathematical rules apply and follow PEDMAS; parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. For example type 14/2+5 into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: 14/2+5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='14/2+5')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then type 14/(2+5) into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: 14/(2+5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='14/(2+5)')

- Class: text
  Output: The rules that have been applied result in two different answers so care needs to be taken to ensure you are completing the correct calulation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Next up, square roots. You can find the square root of any non-negative number by using the sqrt function. Use the console to find the square root of 9. (Provide the desired number of 9 to x i.e. x=9)
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(x=9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(x=9)')
  Hint: Type sqrt(x=9) into the console and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: At some stage you may need to translate more complicated arithmetic formula into code. Some expressions may require extra parentheses especially when dealing with exponents in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If the exponent itself is an arthimetic calculation then it must appear inside parentheses. For example 2 to the power of 3 plus 1 would be 2^(3+1). What would 2 to the power of 4.25 minus 1/4 be?
  CorrectAnswer: 2^(4.25-1/4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2^(4.25-1/4)')
  Hint: The exponent 4.25-1/4 would be inside the parentheses

- Class: text
  Output: Note that R treats negative numbers as a calculation. This would mean -3 is seen by R as -1*3. Therefore to the power of -3 would be written as 2^(-3).

- Class: text
  Output: Next area to look at is Logarithms and Exponentials.A logarithm (log) calculates the power to which you must raise the base to get x. For example, x=25 to base 5 is 2 because 2^5 is 25. (Written in R as log(x=25, base=5))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the log of 729 with a base of 3.
  CorrectAnswer: log(x=729,base=3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='log(x=729,base=3)')
  Hint: x=729 , base = 3

- Class: text
  Output: The default behaviour of log is to use the natural log. The natural log fixes the base as Euler’s number, known as e and is approximately 2.718. e or exp in R is the inverse of the natural log. For example exp(x=2) is 7.389056 and the log(x=7.389056) is 2.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Find the exponential of 4
  CorrectAnswer: exp(x=4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='exp(x=4)')

- Class: text
  Output: All results so far in this lesson have been printed to the console. To save the results for further operations/calculations you will need to assign/store the results to an object/name.

- Class: text
  Output: There are two ways to assign a result to an object; using arrow notation (<-) and using the equal sign (=). For example, x <- 10 and x=10. The object can be a letter, like x, or a name like myobject. For example, myobject <- 10.

-  Class: cmd_question
   Output: Calculations can also be stored within object. Store 5 squared plus 5 in an object named firstobject using arrow notation.
   CorrectAnswer: firstobject <- 5^2 +5
   AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='firstobject <- 5^2 +5')

-  Class: cmd_question
   Output: You can overwrite your object using notation like by stating your object name in the calculation. For example x = x+1. Overwrite your object by dividing itself by 6.
   CorrectAnswer: firstobject <- firstobject/6
   AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='firstobject <- firstobject/6')
   Hint: For this question, make sure there are no spaces within the calculation.

-  Class: cmd_question
   Output: To print the result to the console, simply type your object name and press enter. Print firstobject to see the result of the last calculation.
   CorrectAnswer: firstobject
   AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='firstobject')

- Class: text
  Output: It’s important that when you choose the notation to store objects, either = or <-, that you are consistent with that method. In this course arrow notation will be used.

- Class: text
  Output: There are reserved and protected names that cannot be used as object names in R as these names are required to protect fundamental operations and data types used in R. There’s a summary of these reserved and protected names located in…. alongside a summary of this lesson and the important code covered.

- Class: text
  Output: To finish, there are numerous data types in R. The most basic include;

- Class: text
  Output: Numerics - values like decimals

- Class: text
  Output: Integers - natural numbers like 2

- Class: text
  Output: Logical - boolean values TRUE and FALSE

- Class: text
  Output: Characters - text or string values
