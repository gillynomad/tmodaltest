  Author: Sarah Gill
  Type: Standard
  Organization: TModal
  Version: 2.4.3

- Class: text
  Output: The first lesson explores the basic building blocks of R and its programming language

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In its simplest role, R can be used as a mere calculator. For example, type 2 + 3 into the consule and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 + 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 + 3')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: R will simply print the answer of 5. In R, standard mathematical rules apply and follow PEDMAS; parentheses, exponents, multiplication,
          division, addition, subtraction. For example type 14/2+5 into the consule.
  CorrectAnswer: 14/2+5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='14/2+5')

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then type 14/(2+5) into the consule.
  CorrectAnswer: 14/(2+5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='14/(2+5)')

- Class: text
  Output: The rules that have been applied result in two different answers so care needs to be taken to ensure you are completing the correct calulation.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can find the square root of any non-negative number by using the sqrt function. Find the square root of 9. (Provide the desired number of 9 to x i.e. x=9)
  CorrectAnswer: sqrt(x=9)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sqrt(x=9)')
  Hint: Type sqrt(x=9) into the console and press Enter.
